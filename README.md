# Lab-I---Dimensionality-Reduction
Lab I - Dimensionality Reduction from Machine Learning II

Autor : Lina María Martínez Arias

Workshop I:


Point 1. Simulate any random rectangular matrix A: The solution at this point can be found in the "Matrix Operations" folder.

Point 2 and 4. Add a steady, well-centered picture of your face and Apply SVD: The solution to these points can be found in the "Image Processing" folder.

Point 3, 8 and 11. Create the unsupervised Python package with PCA, SVD and TSNE, PCA more robust and use your unsupervised Python package as a basis to build an HTTP server: The solution to these points can be found in the "Unsupervised_model" folder.

Point 5, 6 and 7. Train a naive logistic regression on raw MNIST images to distinguish between 0s and 8s, apply dimensionality reduction using all your algorithms to train the model and Repeat the process above but now using the built-in algorithms in the Scikit-Learn library: The solution to these points can be found in the "Naive logistic regression" folder.

Point 9 and 10. What are the underlying mathematical principles behind UMAP and behind LDA? The solution to these points can be found in the "UMAP and LDA" folder.
